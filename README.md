# Feature Engineering for Sales Price Prediction Dataset

Welcome to the Feature Engineering for Sales Price Prediction Dataset repository! This feature engineering process is designed to enhance the dataset quality and relevance for accurate sales price prediction. The repository contains the code and resources to replicate the feature engineering steps and run the associated Jupyter Notebook.

## Feature Engineering Tasks

This feature engineering process involves the following key tasks:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the dataset's structure and characteristics using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

2. **Handling Missing Values**: Addressing missing values through imputation or deletion strategies to maintain data integrity.

3. **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying anomalies or outliers that can distort predictions and assessing their validity.

4. **Removing Outliers**: Removing verified outliers to enhance model robustness and minimize noise.

5. **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying relationships between features and the target variable using correlation coefficients and visualizations.

6. **Feature Importance Assessment**: Measuring the impact of features on predictions using decision tree-based methods and permutation importance.

7. **Identifying Significant Features**: Determining features that strongly influence the target variable and considering the removal of less significant features.

## Steps to Run the Notebook

To replicate the feature engineering process and run the associated Jupyter Notebook on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

3. Data Setup: Prepare your sales price prediction dataset and place it in the appropriate location (e.g., `data/` directory).

4. Open Jupyter Notebook: Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `Feature_Engineering.ipynb` notebook.

5. Run the Notebook: Execute the cells in the notebook to perform EDA, handle missing values, detect anomalies, remove outliers, perform correlation analysis, assess feature importance, and identify significant features.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:


git clone https://github.com/Jagannath771/sales-price-prediction-feature-engineering.git
cd sales-price-prediction-feature-engineering


2. Install Dependencies: Install the required Python packages using `requirements.txt`:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Data Setup: Prepare your sales price prediction dataset and place it in the appropriate location (e.g., `data/` directory).
